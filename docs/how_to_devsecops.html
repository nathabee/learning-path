            <h2>Key Principles of DevSecOps</h2>
            <p>DevSecOps is an approach to software development that integrates security practices within the DevOps process. It aims to automate and enhance the security of applications from the initial stages of development through to deployment and beyond.</p>
            <h3>Security as Code</h3>
            <p>Security practices are integrated into the development process using automated tools and scripts. This ensures that security is built into the application from the start.</p>
            <h3>Shift Left</h3>
            <p>Security is addressed early in the development lifecycle, rather than being an afterthought. This involves incorporating security checks, code analysis, and vulnerability assessments early in the development process.</p>
            <h3>Automation</h3>
            <p>Automated security testing tools and processes are used to identify and fix vulnerabilities quickly. This includes continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that automatically run security tests.</p>
            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Developers, security teams, and operations work together seamlessly. This cultural shift ensures that security is a shared responsibility across all teams.</p>
            <h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure helps detect and respond to security threats in real-time. This includes using tools for logging, monitoring, and alerting on security events.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Security</strong>: By integrating security into the development process, vulnerabilities can be identified and mitigated early, reducing the risk of security breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faster Development</strong>: Automated security processes allow teams to develop and deploy applications faster without compromising on security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Costs</strong>: Early detection of security issues is generally less expensive to address than fixing vulnerabilities post-deployment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance</strong>: Automated security practices help in maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations.</li>
